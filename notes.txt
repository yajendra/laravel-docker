docker-compose up 
Check the terminal it will show the db host
Error - SQLSTATE[08006] [7] could not translate host name "db" to address: nodename nor servname provided, or not known (SQL: select * from "users")

Change the db host in .env file with the host shown in terminal
My Case - I have changed ir from db -> 0.0.0.0
it works 


In order to run redis we need to install predis 
Error - Class 'Predis\Client' not found
so in your project folder 
composer require predis/predis
it also updated in my composer directory 
so it will be intsalled by default

same error as in db hostname not able to resolve 
so i have updated the .env file REDIS_HOST from redis to 0.0.0.0.
error solved 

php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

php artisan cache:clear
